# A list of repositories developed relevant to work conducted throughout my thesis
## Documentation varies based on specificity of repository. General code repositories (Python, MATLAB, R) will have copies of scripts that I'm actively working on, but little to no documentation. Repositories made for use by others will have substantial documentation, and even video recordings in some.
